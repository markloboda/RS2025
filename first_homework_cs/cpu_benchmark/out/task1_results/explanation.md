These results come from experiments that vary two key architectural parameters—issue width and reorder buffer size—and they directly affect how well the processor can exploit instruction-level parallelism (ILP) through out-of-order execution. Here’s why the numbers turn out the way they do:

Key Concepts
Issue Width:
This parameter represents how many instructions the processor can dispatch (or “issue”) per cycle. A higher issue width means the processor has the potential to execute more instructions simultaneously if other conditions (like available resources) are met.

Reorder Buffer Size (ROB Size):
The ROB is used to hold instructions that have been issued but not yet committed. It allows the processor to execute instructions out-of-order while maintaining the correct program order for results. A larger ROB gives the processor a wider “window” to find independent instructions and hide execution latencies.

Explaining the Results
Small ROB Sizes (e.g., Size = 2):

Observed Behavior:
In runs where the ROB size is only 2 (Runs 2, 7, 12, 17), the Instructions per Cycle (IPC) is very low (0.18) and the Cycles per Instruction (CPI) is high (around 5.54).

Why:
A ROB size of 2 is extremely restrictive. The processor quickly runs out of space to queue instructions, meaning it cannot keep enough instructions in flight to efficiently cover delays (such as waiting for memory or execution unit availability). This causes significant stalling, regardless of a higher issue width.

Moderate to Large ROB Sizes (e.g., Sizes 16, 32):

Observed Behavior:
When the ROB size is increased to 16 or 32 (for example, Run 1 vs. Run 3, or Run 6 vs. Run 8), the IPC is substantially higher (ranging from about 0.543 to over 1.36) and the CPI correspondingly drops (1.84 down to around 0.73–1.1).

Why:
A larger ROB provides more room for instructions to be queued and scheduled out-of-order. This means the processor can look further ahead to find independent instructions, hide latencies more effectively, and thus achieve higher IPC. The difference between ROB 16 and ROB 32 may not always be huge if the window is already large enough to cover typical latencies, but in some cases (especially with higher issue widths), the extra capacity pays off.

Effect of Increasing Issue Width:

Observed Behavior:
When comparing runs with different issue widths (1, 2, 4, 8) while keeping a sufficiently large ROB, you see that the IPC increases. For example, with ROB 16, IPC goes from 0.543 (issue width 1) to 0.91 (issue width 2), to 0.985 (issue width 4), and 1.05 (issue width 8).

Why:
A higher issue width means the hardware can potentially fetch and dispatch more instructions per cycle. However, this advantage is only realized if there are enough instructions waiting (i.e., if the ROB is not the bottleneck) and if the instruction stream has enough ILP. When paired with a small ROB, even a wide issue width cannot improve performance because the ROB restricts how many instructions can be in flight.

Total Cycles:

Observed Behavior:
Total cycles (the overall execution time) decrease as the IPC increases. For instance, higher IPC (due to a wider issue and larger ROB) results in lower total cycle counts.

Why:
Total cycles are inversely related to IPC for a fixed number of instructions. When the processor is more efficient (higher IPC and lower CPI), it completes the workload in fewer cycles.

Summary
Small ROB sizes severely limit performance because they restrict the number of instructions that can be in flight, leading to stalling and low IPC regardless of the issue width.

Larger ROB sizes enable better exploitation of ILP by allowing more instructions to be queued and executed out-of-order, which lowers CPI and reduces total cycles.

Increasing issue width improves performance only when supported by an adequately large ROB. If the ROB is too small, the benefit of a wider issue is lost.

In essence, these results highlight a classic trade-off in microarchitecture: balancing the ability to issue multiple instructions (issue width) with the capacity to manage them (ROB size) to maximize throughput and minimize execution cycles.
